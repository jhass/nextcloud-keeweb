# Keeweb for Nextcloud

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is an open source, self-hosted file sync and share and communication app platform.
[Keeweb](https://keeweb.info/) is a web application for working with databases of the Keepass password manager.

This integrates the two with each other. Just click on a \*.kdbx file in Your Nextcloud to open it.
