# Keeweb for Nextcloud

**WARNING: KeeWeb itself is not maintained any longer (see note about NC 28 and newer below) and future versions of Nextcloud may not be supported any longer!**

**Clarification about the KeeWeb upstream for July 2024: eventhough there is some recent activity in the upstream project, the issue
https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/issues/2022 is still not closed and there is also no new release of KeeWeb yet
(see https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/releases).**

**Also keep in mind that KeeWeb only supports files in KDBX 3 format. Files in KDBX 4 format will get corrupted when opening and editing them in KeeWeb,
see [https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/issues/2001](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/issues/2001)! So keep your files in KDBX 3 format if you want to
use them in KeeWeb as well!**

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is an open source, self-hosted file sync and share and communication app platform.
[Keeweb](https://keeweb.info/) is a web application for working with databases of the Keepass password manager.

This integrates the two with each other. Just click on a \*.kdbx file in Your Nextcloud to open it.

**Note about Nextcloud 28 and newer:**

Thanks to the help by @florian-forestier, in January 2024 a new release was published which supports Nextcloud 28.

However as of July 2024 the upstream project "KeeWeb" did not get any official new release since
July 2021 (also see https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/releases).

You may have a look at https://github.com/jhass/nextcloud-keeweb/issues/204 (KeeWeb upstream maintenance) and/or
https://github.com/jhass/nextcloud-keeweb/issues/221 (Maintainers for KeeWeb for Nextcloud).

Any help is appreciated!

## Install

1. Go to the releases page, download the latest version.
1. Extract it to `your_nextcloud/custom_apps`, for example with `tar xvf keeweb-0.6.20.tar.gz -C /path/to/your/nextcloud/custom_apps`.
1. Go to "Apps" and then "Not enabled", scroll down to "Experimental" and enable it.

To update to a new version, simply repeat these steps.

## Development setup

```
git clone https://github.com/jhass/nextcloud-keeweb.git
cd nextcloud-keeweb

# You can skip this if you only want to build the appstore or source packages
git clone -b stable20 https://github.com/nextcloud/server.git nextcloud
ln -sf "$(pwd)/keeweb" nextcloud/apps
cd nextcloud && git submodule update --init && cd -

git clone https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb.git keeweb-source

# Install npm -- this might require a more recent npm than your distro's, see https://github.com/nodesource/distributions on how to deploy it
# Once npm is installed, install grunt and bower; instead of relying on your distro's, you can do
sudo npm install -g grunt

# Build nextcloud-keeweb - this will build with the current tested release
# If you want to update to a newer version of Keeweb or use the development version, you also need to modify the patches for it
bin/build

# Finally, run the nextcloud server
bin/server
# Alternatively, you can build the app package to test on a running nextcloud by doing
cd keeweb
make dist
# The package that can be installed in the nextcloud app folder is here: ./build/artifacts/appstore/keeweb.tar.gz
```
